"""probe126 = probe125 with the success case announced.

probe125 produced **nothing at all** on a volume-up short press. That is ambiguous, and
the ambiguity is a design fault of mine: probe125 says nothing when it succeeds, and its
audio is **79 ms at -21 dBFS** -- quiet and brief enough to miss entirely. So "nothing"
could mean either the hook never fired, or every call worked and the sound went unheard.

probe126 changes exactly one thing: **on success it speaks `0x13` "voice prompts off"**,
via the same message handler the failure ids use (the only reporting mechanism proven to
work -- probe99). Now:

    "voice prompts off"  -> all six calls SUCCEEDED, including malloc(317). If no sound
                            was heard, the path works and the problem is purely level and
                            duration, which is a tractable, separate job.
    "lost"               -> malloc(317) returned 0; the 318 pool block is taken too, and
                            the heap is closed for good.
    "disconnected"       -> no .kap loaded; play music first.
    "voice prompts on"   -> StreamKalimbaSink(3) returned 0.
    "connecting to" / "connecting" / "english" -> region source / ADPCM / start returned 0.
    **nothing at all**   -> now unambiguous: 0x10823 did not fire on a volume press.

Everything else is probe125 unchanged: hook `0x10823` (any button, any state -- the
dispatcher's common exit, since `0xAE0`'s gate 1 requires the press to mean enter-pairing
and that clears the A2DP-streaming latch gate 3 depends on), gate on `0x400d`
EventUsrMainOutVolumeUp, `KalimbaSendMessage(0x1072, 8000)` to arm the port, `malloc(317)`
sized to the 318-word pool block rather than the 320 that demanded the single taken 642,
and no teardown.

**Play music, pause it, then SHORT-PRESS VOLUME UP.** Repeatable.
